# Notes App :bookmark_tabs:

I developed a web application for taking and saving notes. It includes:

- Sign-up and sign-in
- Differents views for each user (you only can edit and see your own notes)
- Differents views depending on whether you are logged in or not
- Create, edit and delete title and body of the note
